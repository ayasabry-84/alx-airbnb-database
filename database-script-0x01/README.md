# Database Schema â€“ Airbnb Clone

This script (`schema.sql`) defines the database schema for an Airbnb-like application. It includes:

- Table creation for all entities (users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, messages)
- Primary and foreign keys
- Constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK
- Indexes on frequently queried fields

The schema is designed to ensure data integrity, scalability, and optimal performance.
